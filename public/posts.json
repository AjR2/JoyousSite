    "content": "Personal accountability is a topic that I think I discuss regularly with the people around me. It is complicated to always take responsibility for your own life when it is so easy to blame others. It makes even more difficult when no one is looking to hold to that personal responsibility. If I do everything by myself it is much easier to forego attending the gym today because the only person I am accountable to is myself. This is why it can be helpful to have someone that you are accountable to in addition to yourself, or said another way having a friend with similar goals as you.\n\nI think that no matter what I have done in this lifetime I have always found people that share similar goals as me. When I was busy doing drugs in high school I never had a problem finding someone with a similar goal of getting stoned with me. Additionally, when I was looking for people who were just trying to enjoy life in my early twenties I found them as well. We all had a similar purpose.\n\nThe same goes for my life now. Typically, I tend to find people who have similar goals as I do. The only difference now is that I have a life that I am responsible for, and so it is not as easy to go out and seek others who have similar goals as I do. Some of those is also because being highly motivated these days, finding other highly motivated people becomes more complex because they are out doing what they need to do as well.\n\nThat doesn't mean that it is impossible to find these people, or to begin to make those connections. I have been incredibly fortunate in that I have found some excellent friends that share similar goals, that help me to remain accountable. One thing I especially appreciate doing is reading a book at the same time as friends. It keeps me accountable to picking up the book even when I don't want to. We agreed that we would discuss the book in a week, I better finish it by then.\n\nThis method of setting goals with another human changes the dynamics of the friendships that I do have. They force me to focus on my goals even when I am not actively taking any steps towards them. It may not be an overwhelming sense of focus, but it is enough to ensure that I don't lose sight of what is important to me in this lifetime. It plays a huge role in developing healthy relationships with those around me. I have been single for a considerable period of time, but I look forward to setting shared goals with a partner when I do finally meet someone, and decide to share my life with a partner. To me it is one of the most healthy forms of relationships. Those centered around shared goals, rather than shared fears.\n\nSharing our goals with others can help strengthen bonds, deepen understandings, and increase our likelihood of accomplishing our goals. It also gets us to focus on what could be in a positive manner rather than a negative manner. When I was young my relationships centered around fear based goals. Now my relationships with others allow me to develop relationships centered around positivity instead of negativity. This is like a growth engine for my mental health. The more positive I am the better my mental wellbeing is. Personally, this is one of my favorite tools for mental health because it focuses on building meaningful relationships that last with other people."

    "content": "Just over 11 years ago I had a very serious conversation with myself. My life was not where I wanted it to be, and I was having trouble figuring out where my life was headed. Fortunately and unfortunately for me this time period coincided with the birth of my son. What a wonderful event, but I could only enjoy it up to the point that the stress of how will I support him would allow me to. It was during this time that I vowed to do whatever I had to do in order to take care of him. I quit smoking the day he was born, and immediately began taking action to ensure that his needs have always been met. This is still a major reason for why I do a lot of the things I do today.\n\nHaving a child is a major event, and not everyone should, nor needs to wait for an event like this in order to develop their personal mission statement. A little bit of reflection is all that is needed in order to develop that personal mission statement. It begins with understanding what your values are. Sit down and develop a list of the 3-5 things that matter the most to you. Take 5-10 minutes and brainstorm. Go deep, and really think about what are the things that would make your life duller if you didn't have them in your life.\n\nOnce you have done that Identify a purpose that aligns with what you just brainstormed on. Maybe you are someone who wants to help others succeed in your profession. For me, I want to ensure that no one has to suffer needlessly with mental health issues, like I did for so many years. This purpose is going to grow and sustain you through some of the most tumultuous times, so make sure it is personal, and that you connect with it on a deep level.\n\nThe next step is to refine your statement by selecting what kind of tone you want it to take. This sounds a little silly, but it really is important when crafting your purpose statement. Again, it must resonate with you on a deep level in order for it to sustain you through the darkest times you will encounter throughout your life. For me, I am obsessed with the words like joy, contentment, gratitude, and bliss. These words all carry with them a certain tone that inspire good vibes for all who experience them. Understanding the tone that I want my statement to take can then assist with the next step in crafting a personal mission statement.\n\nNow that we have a purpose, a tone, and have reflected on our values we are ready to craft our statement. This can be as long as you want, but you need to be careful because making it long just for the sake of adding more to your purpose can backfire really quickly. You also want to make sure that it encompasses what you want it to, so I would suggest a 1-2 sentence statement. Based on the previous few paragraphs the statement I crafted for myself was \"I live to empower people struggling with mental illness, by providing knowledge and assistance, so that they can find their joy\".\n\nThis statement has gotten me through some of the darkest times in my life. Life is not easy for anyone. As far as I am concerned no one gets out of life unscathed. Some definitely have it worse than others, but that is not the purpose of this post. In times of darkness repeating that statement helps me to keep going in spite of the overwhelming evidence that I should give up. Since developing my purpose I have been able to do things I never imagined doing, and I am still going. In spite of all evidence that I should just give up I keep going each and every day because I know what my purpose is.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that just because you developed your statement once doesn't mean that it is set in stone never to change. It can and should evolve as you evolve. When I was in my twenties thinking about this for the first time, I never would've expected my statement to change over the years, but it has many many times. It is good that it does. As we get older we learn more about what makes us tick, and those new insights should be used to refine our mission statement, so that it can sustain us through those difficult times."

    "content": "We could spend our entire lifetimes trying to understand creativity, and I doubt it would be enough to uncover the true wonders that creativity has to offer. For our context today we are going to look at creativity as a mental wellness tool rather than a tool for productivity. I know that for me personally, I experience the most amount of peace when I am engaging in creative activities. For me, without them I struggle to find purpose. Being creative fuels my inner wellbeing.\n\nThat being said we should probably dig into why creativity can have an impact on mental wellness in the first place. The obvious concept that I think of every time I think about creativity are flow states. I am sure that at the very least you have heard about flow states, and that when they were discovered there was extensive optimism about what these states hold for us.\n\nI won't dig too deep into the neuroscience of flow states, but we do need to discuss what happens in the brain at a high level to understand why these states have such a large impact on mental wellbeing. During flow states our prefrontal cortex's activity decreases. This means that our self-criticism, our sense of time, and problem solving decisions are all blunted. I don't know about anyone else, but any time away from self-criticism is a massive benefit. Additionally, when we achieve these states Dopamine floods our system to boost motivation and focus. It's incredible that during these states our brain is overloaded with a feel good chemical. The other benefit that I will mention is that our brain also releases norepinephrine which increases our alertness and energy. All of these combine create a powerful mental wellness booster. It is hard to feel bad after experiencing a flow state.\n\nNow you may be thinking isn't this post supposed to be about creativity. Yes, of course it is, but I have a hard time discussing one without the other. Creativity and flow both work in tandem because due to the nature of flow you are more likely to enter into those states when doing something creative. Creativity can be used as a precursor to flow states which can significantly boost mental wellness and output.In order to begin your creative journey it is as easy as taking a few minutes a day to engage in creative work. The idea of micro habits comes to mind when thinking about incorporating creative activities into your daily routine. Especially with flow states you need a considerable amount of time to achieve them, but in order to begin getting the benefits of creative activities you only have to start small. You can doodle for just a few minutes at the beginning or the end of your day.\n\nIn order to increase your chance of successfully incorporating it into your habits add it to a habit you have already formed. Play a three word story game during your morning coffee. To do this choose three random words, and then create a story based on those three words. Anything that is fun and relaxing that you can do can have immense benefits to your mental wellbeing.\n\nCreativity should be a fun exploration of what it is that you enjoy. If at any time you find yourself not enjoying your creative activity of choice change the activity. It should not feel like a chore. Remember, you don't have to achieve a flow state every time, or even ever, but those small micro habits can help you to achieve those states when doing a more in-depth creative activity. These activities can greatly impact your mental wellbeing, and your fulfillment with life overall, so get out there and create a new creative habit that will be enjoyable for you."

    "content": "Spending time in nature is one of the best things that we can do for our mental wellbeing. There a multitude of benefits that come from spending time in nature. The most obvious being that we get more sunlight when we are out in nature. This is a big deal because we produce more vitamin D, and all around increased energy levels. Who doesn't want more energy levels. Even if you supplement with vitamin D it is not the same as spending a few hours in nature to assist in the production of vitamin D.\n\nThis is only one of the more obvious benefits of spending time in nature. Another benefit is access to flow states. Flow is that concept that the guy with the name that I can't pronounce talked about on that ted talk, and then everyone became obsessed with flow (His name is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi). I am sure you are thinking how do flow states relate to spending time in nature. Depending on if you are a social butterfly, or someone who prefers to spend time with themselves you tend to be able to fall into a state where you can enjoy either your own company or the people with you on a deeper level.\n\nThis tends to be possible due to having fewer distractions in nature. Especially has I have gotten older I have been able to find beauty in nature that I was never able to find when I was younger. Being that I prefer my own company sometimes in order to recharge I find immense joy in going out for a hike and upon reaching the summit looking out and seeing the wonder that is nature all around me. It really is two-fold because not only do I get to see wonderful scenery, but I also accomplished a hike that was more difficult than my normal walk. This also applies to when I am hanging out with people on a hike as well.\n\nI am less concerned with all the stress and concerns I have in daily life. To connect it with last weeks post my predictive processing unit is going as wild because most of the scenery I am intaking is foreign, so I am able to be more present in the world around me leading to a deeper flow state. Flow states have immense benefits for us, and I look forward to going deeper into this topic in another post.\n\nIn addition to flow states and vitamin D we also have a tendency to move more when we are spending time in nature. For me movement has been like an anti-depressant for me for quite a while. It turns out that there is research to back those claims up. I want to preface this with I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder beginning around 5th grade. The study was published at neurosciencenews.com,  https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=cerebellum+anxiety. It says that increased Serotonin in our cerebellum. The cerebellum is a region that is typically associated with ensuring smooth movements, among many other things beyond the scope of this post. Movement has been linked to increase serotonin levels which can help reduce anxiety levels. Reduced anxiety alone for me is a huge selling point to go into nature.\n\nThere has been some complex discussion in this post, and it kind of jumps to a few different places. In my mind this shows that spending time in nature is multifaceted, and improves multiple aspects of your life. You may be thinking \"I am not a big nature person\". Neither am I, but I have learned to thoroughly enjoy what little time I get to spend in nature. My hope for all reading this is that you spend a little bit more time in nature, and find any amount of relief that spending time in nature affords us."

    "content": "This is quite the topic for only being two weeks into March. Immediately upon looking at it I cringed a little bit. Not because it is a bad topic, or because it is not an important topic, but because it is an extremely complex topic. On the one hand it is incredibly important to be able to break free of negative thinking patters, and on the other it requires an immense amount of self-reflection. If you are lacking in the self-reflection department (don't worry you aren't the only one) then you need someone who you have immense trust in to be able to assist you in breaking free of these negative thought patterns.\n\nThe first thing that one must keep in mind when beginning the long process that is addressing our negative thought patterns is that you can't change what you are not aware of. Our consciousness actively works to \"trick\" (I put it in quotes because this isn't a bad thing, just how our brain works) us into thinking the way that it has been accustomed to. The brain is a combination of a predictive machine, and a sensory processing machine. One works in a bottom up process, meaning that it intakes sensory information and processes it, and the other makes use of a top down process beginning in the brain before working its way into consciousness. There are two fantastic books about these complex processes \"The Use Illusion\" by Tor Nørretranders (Processing sensory information) and \"Surfing Uncertainty\" by Andy Clark (Predictive processing). I will leave these here in case you are curious and want to learn more about the brains processing when it comes to consciousness.\n\nDespite these conflicting processes they weave complex functionality to create what we know to be our conscious awareness. Now that the complex part is out of the way we can discuss why that is important. We intake a lot of sensory information at any given moment, but not all of that information makes it to our conscious awareness. How does our brain determine what makes it into our conscious awareness. Obviously, it's by determining what is most important for us to pay attention to. I know what your thinking, that may seem obvious, but can you please tell us how to leverage that to break free from thinking patterns. This is where predictive processing comes into play. Your brain has an idea of what's important to focus on based on your daily life experiences. What sensory information provides the greatest action potential, or what do we like the most.\n\nFor the majority of our young existence our brain is constantly trying to figure out what is going to be the stimuli that excites us the most, or what is it that we are most use to. Environment really is everything when it comes to how our predictive mind works. We may not have been in an environment that was conducive to our optimum selves, which in turn drives our negative thinking. We are almost at the point of all of this complicated sensory processing stuff, but it is necessary to explain the importance of being aware of the thoughts that you are having. Without being aware of the negative thoughts it is next to impossible to change the thoughts. They have been so engrained in us for years, and given that the brain is going to send those predictive signals to follow what we are comfortable with we must become aware of the negative thoughts first.\n\nOnly then can we begin to change the negative thought patterns that we have. I strongly suggest having a therapist, or a close friend (not your partner) assist you in identifying those negative thought patterns. Obviously, a therapist is the best choice, but if you are struggling with therapists than a close friend will suffice. Once you are able to bring those thoughts into conscious existence that is when the fun work begins.\n\nYou start simply by acknowledging the negative thought and reframing it. For example, for the majority of my life I believed that nothing good could ever happen to someone like me. This line of thinking is problematic for two reasons. One is because I believed nothing good could happen for me, and the second is that I believed that I was somehow defective, or a bad person. Neither of these statements is true, but this belief severely limited what I was capable of when I was younger. I changed these slowly over time by reframing this thought to, my life is where I want it to be, but I am actively working towards something better each day. Additionally, I also had to address the defective person thought with I have faults, who doesn't, but I also have positive qualities as well. I am neither wholly good, nor wholly bad, just a human being trying to make sense of the complex times we live in.\n\nI am sure at this you're thinking my gosh that was a long winded way of explaining this, and the reason for that is simple. This is not an overnight process. Changing negative thinking patterns takes considerable time. Those negative thoughts don't just go away because I want them to. They go away because I consistently paid attention to them and every time they came up I reframed them in that moment. This is an exhausting process, and takes considerable commitment. Life has a funny way of determining if we really want what we say we do. During the process of reframing you will be constantly tested with situations that will take you to the limits to test your reframing ability. It is a part of the process and must be consistently implemented in order for the reframing to fully take hold.\n\nBased on the prior comments I have made this seem like a daunting task. Truthfully, it is, but that doesn't mean that one is not capable of achieving it. All it takes is determination and consistency. If you are willing to go through the process, and do whatever it takes you should be able to eliminate negative thought patterns. I would love to tell you it will be easy. It won't, but I know that I was capable of reframing negative thought patterns, and can keep addressing them 7 years later than anyone can do it. There is nothing special about me at all. I am just a human being that was willing to commit to whatever it took to improving my life, and it all started with addressing those negative thinking patterns."

    "content": "March has arrived, and in the nation's capital the weather is indicating just that. When I leave the house in the morning it is 30 degrees, and on my way home the temperature has increased to 60 degrees. I hardly feel like I need to address the absurd weather patterns in DC, but I do think that is important to address the changing of seasons from Winter to Spring.\n\nSpring is an excellent time, we clean out our houses, begin planting gardens, and think about summer plans. These can be immensely helpful in dealing with the seasonal depression that can sometimes accompany one throughout the winter months. The days are beginning to lengthen aiding us in finding the energy to make it through the day. It is all around a new way of being that for many has a major impact in their mental wellbeing.\n\nI for one look forward to Spring. It is one of my favorite seasons. I begin planting the seeds for my greenhouses, and I start rethinking my habits that have carried me through the past year. It is a good time to take a mental spring cleaning. To evaluate and assess whether or not my current habits are helping or hindering my progress. Each year there are at least a couple of habits that are no longer serving me, and require a change.\n\nI know what you must be thinking \"how do you change your habits?\". Don't worry- it is actually quite easy to begin creating new habits. It all begins with making small changes to your daily routine. First, I have to identify what it is that I would like to change. The big things that I tend to focus on are breathing practices, gratitude practice, and movement practices. Sometimes, especially throughout the winter I have considerably less energy and practices such as breathing get overlooked. The same can be said for movement and exercise. That is not to say that I stop exercising, or that I stop practicing breathing patterns, but I have a tendency to do less in the winter than I do in the summer.\n\nOnce I have determined what it is that I need to make changes to that is when I can begin to start taking action towards increasing their frequency. For example, this past winter my breathing practices have taken a backseat due to extreme stress and seasonal depression. I brought this into my immediate conscious a couple of weeks ago, and immediately began to make small changes in my daily routine to address them. I now will wake up every morning and engage in a breathing practice. This all began by waking up and taking a few deep breaths. I didn't need to come barreling out the gate, and go back to doing 3 rounds of 40 breaths with an extended hold after the 40. I can work my way back up to that by engaging in the practice everyday.\n\nInevitably, if I begin practicing everyday I will begin to hit plateaus in my breath work. When I hit those plateaus then I can add more reps, or more sets of the practice. This can be translated for any and all habits. I don't have to go running and immediately run a 5:00 minute mile. I can start by running down the block. There is nothing saying that I have to directly from 0 to 100. I just have to get started. Getting started can be the hardest part, but once you do it is considerably easier to keep going.\n\nAfter a few months of just getting started you will be amazed at how much progress you have made. It is possible to fix aches, pains, and difficulties that you won't even realize are gone at first. However, one day you will wake and realize \"Oh, I don't have that lower back pain anymore because I have been stretching every morning for five minutes.\" Again, and I can't stress this enough you just have to get started. Take the first step, and then use the momentum to continue the next day. No matter what don't focus on the result three months from now, but rather on the small actions that you can take daily to increase your mental wellbeing."

    "content": "According to the National Institute of Mental Health there are approximately 57 million people struggling with mental illness. When you consider that there are around 345 million people in the US there is a pretty good chance that you know someone who struggles with any mental illness. While we may know someone who struggles that doesn't necessarily mean that we know how to support that person.\n\nDepending on how we know the person the solution to how we can support them will vary drastically. That is not to say that the solution is going to vary from person to person, but how we approach them will inevitably be different. For example, if someone in my immediate family is struggling I may have a deeper attachment to that person making it more difficult to support them in the way that they need. On the flip side if someone you barely know is struggling with mental illness you may not be invested enough. This has been my experience, but these roles can change and shift depending on the person. Someone could be more detached from family, and more attached to people they have less attachments to.\n\nI know what you're thinking \"all of this is mighty fine\" but you haven't actually provided any insight into how to deal with someone who is struggling. There in lies a great conundrum, and I will refer to the previous post about building healthy boundaries in relationships. Really, all I mean by that is that the situation requires one to be present and available. There is no one size fits all answer for what should I do to support someone with mental illness. The reason being that many of us tend to react in different ways. On top of that the way someone struggling can vary depending on the day.\n\nRecently, I was struggling with manic depression. For a couple of days I would be deeply depressed and struggle to get out of bed, and a couple of days later, I would be manic and anxiety ridden. Things can go sideways quick if you approach someone struggling with depression the same way you approach someone in the middle of an anxiety attack. One thing is for certain, the best thing that you can do is be present and listen. Many people struggling with mental illness struggle with feelings of being heard. Not having someone listen to them because we can pay a therapist to do that for us, but actually having someone that hears the things that we are saying. Having someone acknowledge that things must be really tough at the moment can be a monumental savior for someone struggling with mental illness.\n\nNow, that does not mean that you should approach that person that you know that has been struggling for the past few months and tell them that you hear them. Chances are that person has an uncanny ability to discern if you are full of doodie (that's right I used doodie). You want to approach the situation with as much sincerity as humanly possible. I understand that this may be difficult, especially if you yourself has not struggled with mental illness before. Dealing with people with mental illness is very tricky because at any second they can flip and the situation can deteriorate quickly. Personally, I have incurred severe physical injuries dealing with people in heightened states. This is not common, and is typically reserved for severe cases of mental illness, but even when dealing with less severe cases we can cause more damage that good if we do not handle the situation appropriately.\n\nThere are a lot of fine lines and caveats to everything that I am saying though. On one hand you should refrain from approaching anyone about their mental illness unless they have brought it up themselves. However, if someone is deeply depressed and seriously contemplating suicide, shouldn't you step in? Personally, I would, but simply to listen, and to ensure that that person felt heard and understood. In no way shape or form would I jump in and start trying to convince that person to go get help. This will only hurt the situation, and your credibility. It is best just to listen, so that they can come to the conclusion that they need assistance on their own, and they will provide they have the right outlet, and feel comfortable talking to you.\n\nUnder very few situations should you ever force someone to seek help or treatment. I know this seems counter-intuitive, but it is incredibly important. I have been on the receiving end of this many times throughout my life. Sometimes it was necessary, and sometimes it was not. I have suffered with severe mental illness in my lifetime, and in those moments I am glad that people forced me to get help because it was mandatory that I get immediate help, or harm would've been caused. However, if there is no immediate harm that will be caused it is best to allow the person you are supporting to make that decision for them. When designing technology a core principle is that whoever is using your product should be in control of what happens with the app, or new piece of hardware. The same applies for people dealing with mental health issues. The only difference is that when a person is no longer capable of making those decisions themselves someone needs to step in to help them manage.\n\nIn order to do this a thorough understanding of the situation is required. A mindful (despise this term, but don't have another) approach must be taken with extreme caution. Think of people struggling with mental illness like defusing a bomb. You need to have a full assessment of the situation, and you need to be equipped with the right tools in order to handle them. At no point in time should a random person on the side of the street be defusing a bomb, we have experts for that. Anyone can become an expert in these matters. It requires remembering everything that we learned in kindergarten. Treat others with respect and kindness, and keep your hands to yourself. You never know how sensory information will be received by a person struggling. Equip yourself with as many tools as possible. Read, a lot, and seek out experts that can provide some insights into what the person you are trying to support is going through. Above all remember that end of the day we are all human beings that just want to be loved and cared for. When I say loved I refer to my previous definition of accepting that person for all of their faults and greatness in that moment, and being completely present."

    "content": "Gratitude was such a complicated topic for me for many years. All the older people I know would tell me to practice gratitude, and I had one response for them. I typically told them to kick rocks. That whole gratitude thing didn't work for me. Obviously, I am different from others and this was not going to be anything that would work for me.\n\nI am pleased to say that I do not believe this anymore. Actually, I am ecstatic because it is quite a miserable way to live when you believe that gratitude is somehow too simple, or beneath you. Gratitude is an excellent way to shift ones focus from negativity to positivity.\n\nMaking the shift from focusing on negative thoughts to positive thoughts is not easy, and it certainly doesn't happen overnight. Gratitude is one of the most effective ways to begin shifting that focus. We have many different types of focus, but one that is especially important here is the idea of selective focus. What selective focus says is that we can concentrate on a specific stimulus while ignoring other distractions.\n\nWe see this when we are asked to remember trivial details from something that happened to us. During the traumatic event that occurred when I was 10 (just making up an example) I decided to focus on the action taken against me in this time. However, my therapist is interested in what color shirt one of the offenders had on. Obviously my response is \"How the f*** should I know\", they caused trauma why would I care about the color of their shirt. This doesn't mean that I was not aware of this detail when the trauma happened, but it does mean that I used selective focus to ignore that piece of information, and focus on the traumatic aspect of the event.\n\nUsing this concept of selective focus we can actually train ourselves to focus on the more positive aspect of life. If I am constantly telling myself that I am grateful for the world and experiences around me eventually I am going to become grateful. Just how long will this take? I don't have an exact timeframe. I would make an estimate of somewhere around 3 months you should begin to notice that you are becoming more positive. It will be a gradual shift. An attitude of gratitude is not something that happens overnight. It has to be cultivated, much like a garden. Plants can take months to grow and bear fruit much like practicing gratitude.\n\nThe benefits of this should be obvious, but we can dive into some of the benefits that happen when we practice gratitude for a sustained period of time. One of the major benefits is positivity. In these cases positivity and negativity do not work like a magnet. If I am a negative person then I am only going to be inviting more negativity into my life. Why is this? I would assume that it has something to do with the fact that we like to be around people who are just like us. We have a strong tendency to seek our people who are similar in our thought process, and so if we are constantly pouting negativity then negativity is what we will receive.\n\nThe beautiful thing about this is that it means that the flip side is also true. If we are positive then we will begin to attract positive people and also positive events that occur in our lives. Don't get me wrong no one is going to get out of this life unscathed, but it will create space for positive events to occur, rather than not having the space for positive events. I don't know about you, but when I experience positive things in life my outlook on life is better, creating an obvious benefit for our mental wellbeing.\n\nAnother benefit of practicing gratitude regularly is the ability to make it through difficult times. As previously mentioned no one goes through life unscathed. There are going to be difficult times in your life. These times don't always have a short time span. Personally, the past few years have been exceptionally challenging. However, practicing gratitude has made it considerably easier to deal with the tumultuous time period I have been experiencing. That doesn't mean that I always feel great, but it does mean that I always am able to find some good in all that is happening and continue my journey despite considerable hardships.\n\nAs far as I am concerned these are two of the most important aspects of living a mentally healthy life. The ability to attract positivity when things are good, and the ability to find the good when everything is falling apart. These are the tenants of Yin and Yang. It isn't an easy endeavor to begin practicing gratitude, especially considering that you won't begin seeing results for a few months, but it is one of the most important steps that you can begin taking today if you want to improve your mental health."

    "content": "If there is one thing that is absolutely certain in this lifetime it is that relationships are a complex topic. We can point to any number of reasons that would make relationships difficult, but for sake of simplicity we are going to focus on communication this week.\n\nCommunication can be hard for any relationship. It is certainly not limited to romantic interests. We all have our own way of communicating, and sometimes our style of communication is received by the other person, and other times it is not. Again, this applies to friendships, relationships with co-workers, our children, etc. No relationship can escape to potential pitfalls of miscommunication.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that all hope is lost simply because communication is difficult. Communication is possible between two people even if they are not communicating effectively. It tends to require a deeper understanding of ones self in order to communicate the necessary information, but even without that understanding there are some methods to be able to set boundaries using effective communication.\n\nOne thing that must kept in mind when setting boundaries in relationships is that the key is honest communication. Sometimes in relationships we tend to sacrifice our ideals for safety and security that the relationship provides. Often times thinking \"Oh this isn't that bad, i'll just deal with it.\" This is not a good mentality to have when dealing with relationship boundaries. If there is an something that is uncomfortable in said relationship you should feel comfortable enough to speak up and say so.\n\nWhen communicating these frustrations, issues, or whatever you want to call them, it is important to keep in mind how to approach the situation. Communicating gets messy when we put a lot of emotion behind our words. Approaching any conversation from a place of neutrality is going to be the best method of communication in these times. When you are talking, potentially, about the shortcomings of others it will be natural for them to get defensive. This is a natural response when anyone is perceiving an attack on their character. One thing is for certain, not everyone wants to change who they are, so if you approach the situation charged with emotion communicating what you need to is going to be considerably more difficult.\n\nIn addition, your mindset when approaching the other person should be one of understanding. The goal of communicating boundaries should not be about convincing the other how they wronged you. It should be to seek to understand the other person and what caused the violation of said boundary in the first place. This can be instrumental in relieving the person of their defensive stance and make it so that they are comfortable speaking about what is bound to be a complicated topic.\n\nThe aforementioned strategies will be necessary to communicate the boundaries that you need in a relationship. The next few considerations are things to keep in mind before and after communicating those boundaries. Before communicating boundaries you should make sure to have taken a thorough inventory to make sure that this is a boundary that you need the other person to follow. Sometimes we can be incredibly self-centered and believe that we have been wronged when in actuality what occurred was not a pressing issue. In relationships we all have to make sacrifices, and we need to be aware of whether we could potentially be in the wrong. If you skip this step don't worry, it will come out when communicating with the other person, so your best course of action is to have taken an inventory of yourself before communicating boundaries with your partner.\n\nThis also brings up the question of what to do if communicating your boundaries goes awry. This is a situation that can occur, and is not a desirable situation. This is why it is imperative to come at the situation with a mindset of understanding and being present when communicating because that can allow you to be aware of what needs to be done in case of communication error. Sometimes if people can not respect your boundaries then it is time to rethink the relationship. This will only be an option if you are open and present to any and all possibilities when communicating. Life is too short to spend it being miserable, so walking away from something that will not serve you is sometimes necessary. However, this can be hard to discern which is where taking your inventory before having the conversation can be helpful. It can help your awareness of the situation and what needs to be done.\n\nWith all of this in mind what becomes to the point to the past few paragraphs you just read. The point is that human beings are complicated individually, and when you add other humans into the mix you have just increased the complexity. This means that you must be aware of what you need, what you are capable of, and where it is you are at fault. Approaching situations with the mindset of seeking to understand, Being open and honest in all our communications, and being present in the moment when having these conversations is instrumental to setting boundaries. There are too many moving parts to be able to say that X will work perfectly. These situations are dynamic, fluid, and need to be treated as such."

    "content": "What a complicated, uncomfortable, and downright unnerving concept. Maybe the idea of Self-Love doesn't bother you, but if you are anything like me this is one of the most difficult tasks you have on your to do list. It is such a simple concept, but it is often the simplest of concepts that are the most difficult things to achieve.\n\nLet us first break down this idea of Self-Love. Again, this is a simple task, but it is far from an easy one. We take the idea of the self and define it as a reflection of who we believe that we are. Then we can take the idea of love and define it as an acceptance of everything good or bad about an entity (person, situation, etc.). Therefore we combine the two, and we define self-love as the acceptance of who we believe ourselves to be. Both the good and the bad parts must be accepted. I would also take this one step further, and say that we must acknowledge the potentially good, or potentially bad, person that we are capable of becoming.\n\nI use these terms good and bad, but I really dislike using them. However, I have not found any terms that sufficiently substitute good and bad. I tell people sometimes that actions have outcomes that we either like or don't like, and maybe that applies in the self-love situation, maybe it doesn't. My main point is please don't get hung up on the idea of good or bad. Understand that true self-love demands the acceptance of our being in its entirety, whatever that looks like.\n\nAs far as I am concerned at this point it should be relatively easy to see the impact that self-love has on mental health, but if it is not that is A-ok. Let's dive into why self-love is imperative for mental health. So many of us when we are young make tradeoffs, especially in middle and high school because we just want to be accepted by our peers. Many of us will do whatever it takes. Not ironically, this age group tends to suffer the most with mental health issues (I'm shocked!). These tradeoffs oftentimes lead us to become people who we did not intend, nor want to be.\n\nWhy is that important you may ask? After you have made all of these tradeoffs you must somehow accept each and every one you made whether it was one you liked or disliked. This can be really difficult for some, especially given the severity of some of the tradeoffs. For example, if I made fun of a disabled kid (truly horrific in my mind) in order to impress an attractive human I wanted the attention of, it could take me a long time to rectify the circumstances under which I chose to do this.\n\nI think that understanding that all of these things are a choice is imperative. We have all made choices about who we are going to become in this lifetime. This makes me think of Jocko Willinks Extreme Ownership Concept. We must accept responsibility for everything that we have done in this lifetime up until this point in order to accept who we are, or to love ourselves. This is very important, no one forced me to become a thief, and no one forced me to be a bully, but these things happened.\n\nSelf-love and mental health are two peas of the same pod. It is very hard to have one without the other. I would venture out to say that many mentally healthy people have plenty of self-love, and that very few people who lack self-love are mentally healthy. This was one of my first stops on the journey to mental wellness for me, and I am eternally grateful for the understanding of these concepts. I continuously return to this concept because if I can accept myself in any situation then it doesn't matter what the situation is. The world can be crumbling around me, but provided I approach the situation and myself with love then there is nothing I can't overcome."

    "content": "I have been hearing quite a bit about sleep recently. Do this to improve your sleep now! Maybe, whatever solution company X is peddling just may have the solution that I have been looking for. I guess I'll go check it out. Upon checking it out I discover that they are charging far more then I am willing to pay for their particular solution. I already have 25 other things I am paying for to try to optimize myself as a human. What is it that I am supposed to do?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not saying that these products don't work, or that they are not a valid solution for whichever sleep issue that they are addressing. Plenty of these tools work very well, but there are things that I am unwilling to pay for in the hopes that it may help me get a better nights rest, not just sleep.\n\nRecently I have discovered a formula that has worked really well for me when it comes to getting a restful nights sleep. I keep the room as cold as I can stand it. Typically, this involves me opening my bedroom windows for the duration of the evening which leaves my room in the low 60's. This is a sweet spot for me. I also take magnesium glycinate. Both of these have helped tremendously in me obtaining better sleep.\n\nThat being said even though I was getting better sleep, my sleep quality was still not great. It was better, but I still felt drained regularly. This week I began doing Qigong exercises before bed, and this has revolutionized my sleep. For those who don't know, Qigong utilizes similar principles as Yoga (movement, stretching, and breathing), but originated in China.\n\nThis simple addition, to what I was already doing, made me realize just how important a restful nights sleep was. I have begun waking up without an alarm clock for the first time in my life. My mental fortitude and overall happiness has increased 10-fold. I am less negative, and able to see more of the possibilities of life rather than the harsh realities I chose to see before.\n\nYou may be thinking those three things helped me to sleep more. Not at all. Those three things allowed me to get a more restful nights sleep. I am sleeping the exact same amount of hours, I am actually able to rest deeply and fully. This is opposed to going through the motions of sleep because I have to. Best of all, 2 of the 3 I do before bed are completely free. Light stretching and breath work, in tandem, may take some of my time, but I get that time back ten times because I wake up refreshed and ready to take on the challenges of the day.\n\nThat is a big deal for me because I work quite a bit these days due to having many irons in the fire, so to speak. There are challenges daily that arise, and I need to be at my best mentally in order to be able address them successfully. Finding the right formula for me to achieve greater quality sleep has been instrumental in ensuring that I show up each and every day at my very best.\n\nIf you are struggling with poor sleep quality it's completely understandable. Especially as we get older getting quality sleep becomes more and more difficult. However, discovering what environment you sleep best in, and investing in a tool or two can assist you in ways you never imagined.\n\nIf you think you have tried everything there is to try and are still not getting the right quality of sleep, I hear you. I have been trying to latest and the greatest tools for the past few years. Many of these tools have yielded little, if any, results. Hang in there and keep going, and you will find the formula that helps you. Your mind and body will thank you if you don't give up. It can be frustrating, but giving up is easy, and won't fix any of the problems you are currently experiencing. Keep it up, put one foot in front of the other and keep trying. It'll all pay off in the end even when there seems to be no end in sight."

    "content": "The idea of creating resolutions dates back thousands of years. Typically, they were for religious purposes, but is nevertheless a practice that humans have been doing for quite a long time. Nowadays, the religious aspect may have gone away, but we are still just as concerned with starting the New Year off right with our many resolutions we come up with each year.\n\nGiven the amount of attention we give to New Years Resolutions one would think that we as humans must have some proclivity to reviewing our lives in the hopes that we are able to transform our existence into something we are proud of. Unfortunately, 80-90% of us will never actually reach those lofty goals that we set out to accomplish. Researchers have identified many barriers that keep us from accomplishing these goals, but today I am going to focus on one of them, Mindful Journaling.\n\nOne of the reasons that people fail to achieve their goals is a lack of progress tracking. This directly relates to the idea of mindful journaling. You may ask what is the difference between tracking your progress, and mindful journaling? The best way that I can describe those differences is trough the following anecdote.\n\nI recently began tracking the progress on my goals for for 2025 because I didn't think that I did a good enough job with this in 2024. With the assistance of an AI I identified a list of questions for a weekly review, and a daily review. I plan to do a monthly review as well, but I have yet to complete that task. I eagerly began journaling everyday, and very quickly noticed that I was simply going through the motions when it came to the daily journaling. I was restating many of the things that I said in prior days, and it was more of a headache then an aid for me.\n\nWhile the daily journaling assisted less than I would have hoped, I found the weekly journaling had a profound impact on my focus and resilience. I discovered that it helped me to remain focused on what was important for the week, and made sure that I stuck to what was important throughout the week.\n\nNow, you may ask how in the world does this highlight mindful journaling? It shows that I was aware enough to understand that the daily journaling I was doing was not efficient. This could be because the questions I was asking were not the right ones to ask. It could be because of a plethora of other reasons, but all I am aware of this time is that daily journaling at this moment is not productive for me.\n\nAgain, this raises a questions that needs to be addressed. What if daily journaling is working for someone else, and not weekly? Great! That is wonderful, I am ecstatic that someone has found something that works for them. This is always something to be celebrated. It is a blessing when people identify a tool or practice that aids them on the epic adventure of life.\n\nThis is where the mindful aspect comes into play. It is not enough to just journal, or utilize a new practice. You must do it in a manner which involves presence, more specifically your presence, or for me, my presence. If I am not present mentally, emotionally, or spiritually when utilizing these tools then I may not notice that a practice is making a major impact on my life, and I stopped because I didn't notice the effect. On the flip side, I may be continuing a practice that is causing me distress in some way and I am not aware enough to notice. Both can have detrimental effects, and prevent us from becoming the limitless beings that we all have inside of us.\n\nIt is imperative that we journal. Having some way of releasing the thoughts in our mind for review, or just because it's Tuesday, is necessary for modern humans. This is a relatively simple task. Carve out a few minutes each week to go ahead and review how it is your doing. I am sure some of you immediately said \"I don't have any time.\" Make the time for yourself. There are a lot of things I don't have time for, but when I make the time for them my life improves exponentially.\n\nDoing this in a mindful manner can have effects on your life that you never thought possible. If it doesn't work for you then all you lost were a few minutes while you tried. However, if it works the benefits are innumerable. Take action today, download a notes app, buy a paper journal. Personalize it, make it your own so that you are more likely to do it. Your future self will thank you for it."

    "content": "I knew a guy who loved to consume alcoholic beverages. We would hang out and he would start consuming large amounts of liquor immediately. Our buddy would always remind them that it is a marathon and not a sprint, to which our friend never listened. This would lead to him passed out within an hour or two, and everyone taking turns embarrassing him while he was passed out.\n\nThis situation is very similar to experiencing burnout while trying to achieve our new years goals. If we come out the gate on January 1 and hit the ground running thats great. This is exactly what we were looking for. However, if we try to accomplish too much too quickly then it will be us who rapidly depletes our energy and motivation, leading to burnout before the year has even begun.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what we want to have happen at the beginning of the year. We want to carry our resolution long into the new year, not fizzle out after a couple of weeks. How do we overcome this? For me, I always have to keep in mind that when trying to achieve my new years resolutions it is a marathon not a sprint. I am not meant to start out the gate as fast as humanly possible, and sputter out halfway through the first or second lap. I need to control the release of my energy to be able to sustain 24 laps at a steady pace.\n\nThis takes a few different forms. One of those is remembering that I still need rest. Just because it is the beginning of the year, and I have some extra energy from the holidays, doesn't mean I have to expend that energy immediately. I can take a day off if my muscles are too sore. I can work a different muscle group if I need to. These are all options especially when it comes to achieving physical goals. This has always been an area, historically, that I have struggled to maintain that marathon mindset.\n\nAnother form it can take is in performing creative or mental work. I desperately want to create as much content as I possibly can, but if I attempt to create too much at one point in time, then all I have managed to do is create subpar content that no one will want to engage with. This is the opposite outcome that I want to happen, so I need to remember to pace myself in creative endeavors as well.\n\nThis all leads me to the way that I tend to see work overall. Work is necessary, whether you like the work you do or not. Whether you found that career that you love or not, burnout can still occur if we push ourselves too hard too fast. Keeping in mind that we make progress through small consistent actions, rather than huge actions taken all at once is mandatory. Additionally, one thought that always helps me when I am on the verge of burnout, which happens more than I care to admit, is that I know absolutely no one who sat on their deathbed saying \"I really wish I had worked more.\"\n\nDo what you have to do, don't use this as an excuse to exist solely in comfort. Push yourself in a healthy and meaningful way that will allow you to complete the marathon that is your life. It's the longest one I know of, at an average of 73 years. Most marathons only take a few hours to complete, so don't try to sprint to the finish line. Accomplish those small victories. Celebrate them, and internalize them before jumping to the next. It is much more effective to make small consistent progress, than massive leaps all at once."

Many of us respond with something that has been bothering us throughout the past year, some respond with \"I haven't thought about it yet,\" and some don't bother to set any resolutions at all (hard to believe, but I know a few). The idea of having resolutions, or a determination to do or not do something, is important for mental health and wellness.\n\nIf we do not want to continue carrying out a specific behavior that's ok, but how will we overcome it if we do not have any resolve to ensure that it doesn't happen again? Having resolutions is a great thing, and we should all take some time at the beginning of the year to determine what we do and do not want to do throughout the next year. It is tremendously helpful in allowing us to stay focused on what's important to us. This allows us to feel more connected, satisfied, and fulfilled. Ultimately leading to better mental health and wellbeing.\n\nNow it may seem that we have found an answer to living a happier and better state of mental wellbeing, but this may not be the case. Resolutions are great, and having determination to carry out these resolutions are fantastic, but not having a plan can be crippling to one's New Years Resolutions. Many of us set out with the epic resolutions that are going to revolutionize the way we live just to give up on them mere weeks into the new year.\n\nSetting intentions is one way to aid us in carrying out our new years resolutions. When it comes to setting intentions, it is really about having a plan. Having a determination to do, or not do, something is wonderful, but combining that with a solid plan of action to achieve that resolution can only help us in achieving those resolutions we so deeply desire.\n\nWhen I create a plan along with my determination very few things can stop me from achieving that goal. It is like supercharging my focus because not only do I have a deep urge to succeed in my endeavors, I also have a foundation that I can build upon by taking the necessary actions. Having a plan assists me in taking those required actions each and every day. Having focus and a plan to achieve my goals makes it so that I am much more likely to achieve those goals.\n\nThe beauty of setting resolutions and intentions like this is that it can be done at any point in time throughout the year. Anyone can set a resolution and intention at any point and begin taking action to accomplish their goals. It is not strictly limited to performing this action in January. However, that being said if you are at a point in life where your awareness settled on creating those resolutions around the new year that's ok. The key is having determination with a solid plan, and you can start taking action to change your life immediately.\n\nThe title of this post is certainly misleading, but as far as I am concerned, is one of the most important things to keep in mind heading into the new year. Resolutions and intentions are not at opposition with each other, but rather are meant to work in tandem. If you can enter the new year with determination (resolution) and a solid plan (intention) then you are much more likely to succeed in your endeavors, and catapult your mental wellness to the place you want it to be in the new year. Get out there write down those resolutions, develop a plan that will help you achieve them, and watch as your life slowly transforms into what you have always wanted."

    "content": "I am unsure which concept I like more, looking ahead or preparing. Both of these concepts are incredible important in the pursuit of mental health. In my opinion it is very difficult to be mentally healthy without doing both of these things.\n\nThe first concept, looking ahead, is tremendously important. You may be thinking why in the world is important to look ahead, shouldn't I be practicing mindfulness? Yes, of course you should, but we all need goals and purpose. Looking ahead is one way to find those goals that we need to obtain in order to determine our purpose. This is not something that you need to focus on every second of every day, but you should be thinking about where you want to be by the end of next year at the very least.\n\nIdeally, you have though even further than that. I once did an exercise where I wrote my obituary and then I worked backward from that. Going back in decade long increments I thought about what I wanted my life to look like at each stage of life. This wasn't a depressing exercise, but rather an uplifting one. It helped to see exactly where I wanted to be at each stage of life, and make goals accordingly.\n\nOne of my favorite books is __The Lion Tracker's guide to life__ by Boyd Varty. I re-read this book every year. In it he talks about not always knowing where he is going, but he knows the process to be able to get there. The process of setting goals, and looking ahead helps us to know which actions to take to get to where we ultimately want to get to which is invaluable. This is especially helpful in moments of semi or complete darkness, and it is difficult to see what the next steps in life are.\n\nThe second concept of preparing your mind is just as important as looking ahead. How is it that I can be ready to experience what I want if I am not in the right mindset. For example, if I want a certain outcome, but my mindset exists in a different outcome then I am won't be available to experience that which I have begun to work for. A more tangible example of this is from when I was attending grad school. I was interesting in technology, and wanted to be a part of building something new that would aid in transforming people's lives. To this end I began building technology, eventually creating a couple of startups. The first startup I created prepared me, and assisted me in developing the mindset I needed in order to create my second startup(both of which are still functioning today).\n\nIf I hadn't known where I wanted to go, and began to seek experiences that would develop my mindset then none of those startups would've been possible. This was a direct result of looking ahead and knowing what I wanted my life to look like. I then began seeking out those experiences that would develop my mindset. Experiences that would mold and shape my way of thinking, so that I would be available when the time came to experience that which I have worked so hard for.\n\nThose are just my examples, and they may not be anything that you are interested in. I totally understand that. This method will work whether you are looking to spend more quality time with family, or whether you want to be the next ruler of the free world. Your mindset is everything when it comes to determining the life around you, and it is difficult to develop that mindset if you do not know where it is that you want to go.\n\nAs the new year approaches do yourself a favor and find a place where you can be quiet for a little bit. The amount of time however long you can afford to be away from others for. For some this may be an hour, for some this could be 5 minutes. Either way make that time. If it is 5 minutes take the time, and do it over the course of a few days. Use that time to determine what it is you want your life to look like over the next year. Write out in as much detail as possible exactly what it is that you are looking for. After that write out some goals that will help you begin to achieve those goals. Once you have achieved those goals keep going. Write some more, and no matter what keep taking action towards what it is that you want. One of the most comforting thoughts for me is that I may not reach all my goals, but I know for a fact that no one can take away the fact that I used every day of my life to attempt to achieve my goals."

    "content": "Prioritizing mental wellness during busy seasons is, as far as I am concerned, a controversial topic. You may be thinking why in the world would this be controversial? Isn't this supposed to be what I am doing? This is what people are telling me to do, are you telling me that I shouldn't?\n\nNo, I am not disagreeing with anyone, nor am I telling you that you should not prioritize your mental wellness during the holidays. I find this controversial because your mental wellbeing should be a priority all throughout the year not just during the holidays. If your anything like me I do not experience mental discomfort on during the holiday season. I experience it constantly throughout the year.\n\nIt is important to note a couple of things from the prior statements. Number one being that mental health should be a priority. I did not state that mental health should be the priority. At some points in time it is going to become complicated to put your mental health first at all points in time. Life happens and you are going to need to prioritize other tasks given the situation. Make sure that you are addressing those events that need to take precedence. For example, if I there is an issue that arise with my kid that requires my immediate attention, but I tell myself I need to prioritize my mental health the situation will only end poorly. Why? because addressing the situation in that moment is a part of me being mentally healthy. If I ignore the situation I am only deteriorating my mental wellbeing by avoiding the situation that is demanding my attention.\n\nAll that being said being healthy is incredibly important for many things related to the holidays. It assists us in showing up for family, in enjoying whatever is going on around us, and it is difficult to show up the way we need to if we are not mentally healthy. However, one of the best ways to remain mentally healthy is by dealing with the unexpected happenings of life as they arise. Procrastination is the worst thing one can do when it comes to remaining mentally healthy. If we look at the prior example I gave, that situation is going to sit in the back of my mind, and annoy me like a gnat until I get up and take care of it. There is no way short of turning to distractions like social media, tv, alcohol, etc. to not have those things we need to do in the back of our mind.\n\nThe beautiful thing about, and quite possibly the most infuriating thing, about the human mind is it tends to know exactly what it needs in order to be healthy (or move forward). This makes it easy to identify the problem, and the solution, but it also makes it incredibly difficult if you are not in a willing state of mind to address those issues.\n\nI relay to everyone I have ever worked with in this lifetime that willingness is 80% of the battle. If I remain willing then it makes no difference if I address my mental issue right away, or in a day or two because I am not avoiding it. Avoidance is the quickest and most effective way to mental illness. Both fortunately, and unfortunately, we live in a era of distraction. It is super easy to pick up a phone and open a social media app where distractions are abundant. I am not trying to demonize distractions because there is a time where they play a vital role. As with everything there is a time and a place for a distraction and it is up to us to identify those times. Remember, our mind knows the difference between us facing our mental struggles head on, and when we are just trying to act like they don't exist.\n\nWhen prioritizing mental wellness during the holidays the important thing to remember is just to be willing to put your mental wellbeing as one of your priorities. This is the most effective way to make sure that you are able to address all the challenges of the holidays, while also maintaining your mental wellbeing. You may be thinking that it sounds like complete BS, but to that I would say don't knock it till your try it. Become completely willing, the key word being completely, not 40, 50 or 70% willing. If you can become completely willing to making your mental wellbeing a priority then you will be amazed at what you can handle during the holidays."

    "content": "I am going to start this out with an underrated quote that many know all too well, \"Just do it\" (Seriously, I never would've thought of that). I know it seems simple, and saying no is that simple. However, this is not where the difficulty arises when agreeing, or not agreeing, to give up your valuable time during the holidays.\n\nTypically, the guilt that is experienced when either saying no, or not saying no stems from some element of trauma. In reality saying no to anyone is not a big deal, and many will not even bat an eyelash if you state you aren't able to attend an event. If they do chances are they have some unresolved trauma themselves (SHOCKER). Happy Healthy humans are not going to berate you, think less of you, or manipulate you because you are too busy during one of the busiest times of the year to make their holiday cookie party. That being said if you bail on people regularly, and your friends haven't seen you in months because you say no all the time this is a different beast entirely.\n\nI think we have hit on the most important thing which becomes more challenging during these times, especially if you have a history of struggling with mental health. That idea is being a happy healthy human. Sounds super easy, but as someone who struggled with mental health for over a decade it is nowhere near as easy as it sounds.\n\nI remember when I was young thinking why am I not happy? Why do I always want to be someone else? Why is what I have not good enough? These were hard questions to answer. It took me over a decade to address them because of them were neurological, not mental. I had suffered a few blows to the head growing up that significantly impacted my mental wellbeing. It took a long time to realize this, and to find the solution that would help me overcome these obstacles (The trick was increasing blood flow and Oxygen to my brain, I still have the book that helped me with this). Something as simple as just be happy, or just say no becomes incredibly challenging when your brain is not functioning the way that it should be.\n\nThe solution start the journey towards becoming mentally healthy today. Don't start tomorrow do it right now. Make the commitment, and decide the first steps to get there. The road to becoming a happy healthy human does not happen overnight. As they say Rome was not built in a day, but it was built brick by brick. Anyone can overcome significant mental health challenges one step at a time. The first step can be as small as telling a loved one you are struggling, and thinking about getting help. It can be as big as scheduling an appointment with a therapist, a psychologist, or a social worker. Any step you take no matter how big or small will aid you in your journey to becoming a happy healthy human. Please take the first step now, you will thank you for it."

    "content": "The holidays are a difficult time for so many of us, myself included. This time of year is especially complicated being that there are so many holidays back to back. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years all happening within a month of each other. This is a lot to process for anyone, let alone if you are a member of the neurodivergent community.\n\nIf your family is anything like mine then that means that it is not only one day of celebration for these holidays, but many days of celebration for the holidays. For Thanksgiving alone we had three days of celebrations (Imagine the Christmas holiday, which is much more important in my family). This is far from a complaint because I do love my family and appreciate their company, but this is a lot of personalities for myself to deal with.\n\nJust a few years ago this was far too much for me to deal with. I would typically have a combination of not going to some of the events, while also spending as little time as I needed to in order to be considered as an attendee of the event. This is not anything that I am proud of, but being around family for that amount of time was simply a lot of stress.\n\nI have addressed the stress of family, but unfortunately this is not the only stressors that we experience around this time of year. Financial pressures mount because if you celebrate Christmas there are presents that must be bought. This is typically an expense that is outside of your normal expenses, and requires some extra budgeting in order for it to be managed effectively.\n\nIn addition to the prior two stressors there is also the stress induced by the change in environment. Where I live the weather not only gets significantly colder, but also considerably darker. Whereas I am used to it being light until 7 at night, suddenly it is dark by 4. This change can lead to seasonal depression in some, which is no laughing matter.\n\nI know what you may be thinking, \"Hey A-hole, its great you have identified all these issues, but is there a solution\". Of course I have some solutions. There may even be one works for you (at least that is my hope). One solution that I rely on is to remember that I still have needs that must be addressed during the holidays. Personally, I am an introvert, so I need my alone time in order to process the world around me. I must take time for myself in order to go for a walk, or read a book. If not the holidays just got one step closer to being overwhelming.\n\nYou may be thinking what if I am not that self-aware yet. That's ok, take a brief inventory before the holidays begin. Ask yourself the question in quiet contemplation, what do I need in order to relax during the holidays? Ask yourself how you can remain level headed throughout the holidays. You have the answers inside, you simply need to bring them into your awareness. You will be amazed if you sit down and ask yourself the questions about the things that bother you the most during the holidays. The answers will come almost immediately if you can sit quietly enough. This does not mean traditional meditation, it just means to sit or walk with no distractions. That means no phone, no other technological devices, and also doing it in solitude. I know the later may be complicated for some, especially single parents, but take 5 minutes when your kids go to sleep, and take this inventory. You will thank yourself for doing it.\n\nMy favorite strategy to use during the holidays is to find a way to be of service. This can be of service to your family, or you can do things for others in your community. This is such an underrated strategy to avoid feeling overwhelmed. When we exist inside of our own bubble it is easy to see our bubble as all there is. Being of service to those around you tends to put everything in perspective, and allow you to appreciate the little things in your life. I personally find ways to be of service at family functions because there are few better ways to stop thinking about myself, than to think about what I can do for other people.\n\nThe holidays are most certainly a stressful time, and very quickly can become overwhelming. However, just because they can be stressful, or they can be overwhelming does not mean that they have to be. Even if you have never had a positive family interaction during the holidays for over two decades it is never too late to form new habits, and begin enjoying the holidays again."

For so many years the struggle with family dynamics were a plague that I was determined to stay far away from. However, since the birth of my first child I was forced to rethink those my approach to those dynamics.\n\nDon't get me wrong there are very few things that make the dynamics of family easier, but that doesn't mean that they are destined to be unpleasant forever. As I have spoken about in prior posts I do believe that this is a matter of walking in with the right mindset.\n\nI am hoping that it is painfully obvious that mindset is not a cure all penicillin. There is no way to will away generational patterns. That comes with hard work and addressing those deep rooted emotions that can send us into a pattern of seething rage, or decapitating depression. That being said that doesn't mean that you have to avoid your family while working through these deep rooted psychological complications.\n\nIf the first thought I have when going to see my family is \"Oh no, this is going to be awful\", then the chances of that wonderful family that only wants the best for me is going to push my buttons the wrong way will jump exponentially higher. If I approach the situation with love, kindness, and excitement then it is much less likely that those same wonderful people will hit those buttons on purpose. There may be an accident here and there, but those moments happen considerably less with the right mindset.\n\nFamily is one of the greatest gifts that any human can have. They are people who will show up for you when things are darkest. They are the only people who stick around for the majority of life, and not simply be there for a year or two at most like many of the humans we will interact with throughout our lives. To pay homage to the prior post having that attitude of gratitude for those people who will be there through thick and thin will forever change the way that you interact with your loved ones."

    "content": "\"An unexamined life is not worth living\". What a message from everyones favorite 5th century BCE philosopher. Who would of thought when he uttered these sagacious words that they would stick around for a few thousand years. Which in my mind leads me to deduce that this must be an incredibly important statement that can have profound impacts on ones life.\n\nThat being said reflection can come with serious issues if not done with care. Typically, with care for oneself. It is incredibly easy to look down on oneself for not being good enough, smart enough, for making silly mistakes, etc. The list goes on and on, and the possibilities of judgmental reflection are far too many to list here.\n\nOne thing that I do everything within my power to do is look at my life with absolutely no judgment at all. Now I know what your thinking, \"F this guy, its not easy\". That assessment would be accurate. However, I have found that it is typically related to mindset. Personally, my mindset determines the level of judgment in my self-reflection.\n\nOne thing that I continually remind myself is that nothing that I do in this lifetime is good or bad. It simply isn't that black and white. This thought in and of itself is super helpful in reflecting on life in a non-critical manner. Based on the actions that I take, there are reactions (consequences, but I dislike this word) that I like, and reactions (again substitute consequences if you want) that I don't like. Due to this fact it is imperative that I analyze life each day.\n\nPersonally, I have a tendency to over examine my life, which I am in no way shape or form advocating for. This is enough to drive any sane person insane very quickly. However, I have an uncanny ability to look at that same life with absolutely no judgment. This lack of judgment affords me the ability to remain in the mindset that I want to be in. It allows me to make changes in my life that are beneficial to keeping that mindset. That keep my mind from deteriorating to a level that I find unacceptable. Allowing me to avoid the depths of despair that plagued me as an adolescent, and young adult.\n\nExamine your life, its great for you. Do so with the understanding that all things are neither good nor bad, they simply have reactions(or consequences) that you want or don't. As soon as you determine which reactions you want keep taking those actions. It will aid you in building the life that you want to live. While Rome may not have been built in a day, it was built brick by brick, which is all you need to do to build a better, healthier life.\n\n"

At that same moment I remember thinking \"F**k you, thats a bunch of phooey\". I understand that its good to be grateful for what you have, but me telling myself I am grateful for something is not going to do anything in my life.\n\nMost of the people who I saw running around telling me how grateful they were seemed like they were full of bologna. It seemed so fake and phony, and I wanted absolutely nothing to do gratitude. Maybe it wasn't gratitude that I didn't want anything to do with, but rather that I wanted nothing to do with what I believed to be inauthentic words that couldn't possibly affect my daily living.\n\nOver a decade later I now realize how wrong I truly was. Not about the lack of authenticity from those preaching gratitude, but wrong about the fact that the act of listing things one is grateful for has a profound impact on our daily lives.\n\nOne of the big problems with gratitude is that it is not immediate. It takes time for the daily gratitude practice to begin to produce an effect. Being an impatient human that was a hard pill to swallow. However, once ones mindset begins to shift towards gratitude Amazing things begin to happen. The circumstances of life will begin to shift, but this takes even longer than he mind.\n\nThe best thing that comes from having an attitude of gratitude is that for the first time in my life, I have been able to sit back and say that I am happy. To come from some of the darkest recesses of the human mind where there is nothing other than a black abyss swallowing us on a day to day basis to being able to say I am happy for the first time in my life is a major shift. It is a shift that is worth every day that I practiced gratitude and saw absolutely no results. It made the years that I spent ignoring gratitude because of its alleged lack of authenticity worth it because now I would not go a single day without finding something to be grateful for.\n\nGratitude produces such a strong mental shift that it should never be understated. You may run into someone who you think is full of bologna, spouting off all kinds of ridiculous things they are grateful for. That's ok, join them. Embrace the phony act of faking it till you make it. Whatever you do, just practice being grateful for the things around you because eventually it is inevitable that your mindset will shift, and your life will become something that you no longer recognize in the best way possible."
